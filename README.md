Note:
- The game must be started on the loading scene so that the player data can be loaded correctly
- The procedural generation system has been adapated from [Sebastian Lague's system](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3). This has been credited in my documentation, my game (in the information menu), and my code. All scripts that were not coded by me have an XML comment at the start of the file stating this.
